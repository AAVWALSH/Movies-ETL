Goal is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data from multiple sources, cleans and transforms it, and then loads the data into existing tables. 

The provided code extracts data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens rating data. Several steps were completed to clean the data of unrequired columns, duplicates, clean up columns titles, and once merged fill in blank fields with data from the superior table. Once the tables were merged it was added to a PostgreSQ Database.
